<h3>Game Synopsis</h3>
<p>
Tank Wars is a top down shooter game where the player plays as a tank and has to navigate around a maze while fighting off an avalanche of enemies in the form of other tanks, that come in phases. The goal of the game is for the player to move to a portal which appears for a limited time, allowing the player to proceed to the next level.

But unlike other shooter games, where the player uses conventional means to take out enemies, such as shooting projectiles, the core/main mechanic of shooting has been taken out. Instead, the player is given the ability to manipulate time through their movements and use it, together with their spatial awareness, to taking out enemies using their crossfire. As stated, the player manipulates time through movement. When the player is stationary, time progresses at a slow rate whereas when they are moving, time progresses at a normal rate. This was a mechanic added to compensate for the removal of the shooting mechanic and not have the player at a disadvantage.

<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>
The given assignment required students to re-implement a previous prototype and improve upon its main mechanics and dynamics. The aim was to 
teach students the process of iterative design and how a game developer must always be able to take what has been made and make it better.
Additionally, the re-implementation of the prototype had to contain elements of well thought out level design as well as good communication 
and feedback systems. 

<h2>Prototype Chosen</h2>
</p>
The original prototype chosen to undergo this process was Tank Wars, as it had great potential and could be improved further, according to feedback from 
play-testers.

<h2>Inspirations</h2>
<p>
Tank Wars takes inspiration from the game Superhot as well as the mobile game Stickman Tank.
The former is a first-person shooter with a twist. In the game, the player attempts to take out enemy targets using guns and other weapons, 
but time within the game progresses at a slow rate unless unitl the player moves, at which it progresses at a normal rate. This creates the 
opportunity for the player to assess their situation and respond accordingly.
<br>
The latter is a fast-paced 3D tank simulator where the player attempts to take out enemy targets using cannons and other weapons.

<h2>Iterative Changes </h2>
There were countless changes made from each iteration, but the most notable of these can be categorised as changes made to the following. 

<h3>Player Perspective</h3>
<p>
In the initial version of the game, the player had a third person perspective of the game but during gameplay, players felt at a disadvantage as they could not see bullets coming towards them until it was too late to dodge. This made the game very challenging to play and enjoy. In order to improve their chances, a mini map that players could use to orienting themselves within the game world and be able to keep track of where enemies were around them, was added. During playtesting, this did not accomplish what was expected as the players, rather than using the main screen, would use the mini map instead. 
</p>

<p>
It was thought best to allow players to switch between cameras by holding down a button, one which would show a third-person perspective and one which would show a top down perspective, as shown below.
Still this proved to be a bit too much for the players as they felt as if the odds were being stacked against them. This resulted in the game being changed to a top down game were the player could see all that there was to see in the game world.

<h3>Level Design</h3>
<p>
In the initial prototype, enemies spawned randomly at specific positions and would move towards the players while shooting at them, with no obstacles for them to move through or a goal(s) for the player to accomplish. This proved good enough for the prototype but could be further improved such that it is of the quality of a vertical slice. This was to be done with the process of dynamic game difficulty balancing in mind. It is the process of automatically changing parameters, scenarios, and behaviors in real time, based on the player’s ability, in order to avoid making the player bored (if the game is to easy) or frustrated (if it is too hard).
</p>

<p>
To accomplish this, it was decided that it was best to set out a goal rather than just having the player try to survive the horde of enemies. This came in the form of different levels where the player had to move around a maze to avoid enemies and after a time, a portal allowing the player to proceed to the next level would appear for a limited time. This greatly improved the quality of the game as well as the experience. Each level would represent a level of difficulty, i.e. in the beginning of the game, enemies would spawn at a very slow rate and the maze would be simple as to make it easy navigate. As the player progressed to other levels, the rate and complexity of the maze would increase gradually, thereby increasing the difficulty.

<h2>Future Improvements</h2> 
<p>
The following section describes the areas with the most potential for improvement within Tank Wars. This iteration of the prototype fell short of the initial vision in many ways, and there were some clear problems within the final design, but given more time most of these issues can be addressed and repaired. 
</p>

<h3>Game feel and Juice</h3>
<p>
Even though the game’s systems and level design were better than before, improvements could still be made. During the gameplay, there was a lack of game feel. While the players interacted with the game, there were no rewards for their accomplishments, accomplishments such as when they would evade enemies for a long period of time or proceed to another level in a short amount of time. This deprived the game from being fun and interactive to such an extent that it felt tedious to play.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2> 
<p>
The given assignment required students to re-implement a previous prototype and improve on its main mechanics and dynamics and followed an iterative design process. Tank Wars was created as a solution to the presented problem. In the beginning it took the form of a challenging third-person shooter game but was later changed to a top down game. The intention was to make a game that fit a certain genre but was missing one of the main mechanics that is usually found in that genre. Play testers responded positively to the main elements of the final product but this iteration of the prototype had some clear problems within the final design which were not up to standard, thus the game could not be considered a complete success, even though it did address much of what it initially set out to do. Given more time, better game feel could be created as well as more visual and audio cues which would bring about a sense of enjoyment from the player.
